## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## ML Integration (Quick Start)

This project includes a small ML prototype to improve career recommendations beyond the existing rule-based engine.

1. Generate a bootstrap dataset using the existing rule-based engine (defaults to 5k samples):

   ```bash
   cd ml
   SAMPLE_SIZE=5000 node generate_bootstrap.js
   ```

2. Train a baseline model (RandomForest):

   ```bash
   cd ml
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python train.py --input data/bootstrap.jsonl --out models/rf_baseline.joblib
   ```

3. Run the inference API (FastAPI):

   ```bash
   cd server
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

4. Run the frontend (normal dev flow) and the results page will call the API at `http://localhost:8000` by default. Use `VITE_ML_API_BASE` to change the URL.

Notes:
- The bootstrap dataset is generated by sampling the input space and using the existing `getRecommendations` function as the labeling function. This provides a quick way to train an initial model; later, replace with real user-labeled data for improvements.
- The model is saved as `ml/models/rf_baseline.joblib` and loaded by `server/app.py`.
- For production, containerize the server (Dockerfile provided) and add monitoring, versioning, and proper privacy handling.

## CI & Tests

This repository includes CI workflows that run unit tests and build/push the server Docker image on `main`:

- Python tests (ML + Server) run via `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` (uses `pytest`).
- Frontend tests run via `.github/workflows/node-ci.yml` (uses `vitest`).
- Docker image for the server is built and pushed by `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` (requires Docker Hub credentials set in repository secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`).

Run tests locally:

```bash
# ML tests
cd ml
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q

# Server tests
cd server
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q

# Frontend tests
npm ci
npm test
```
